## Introduction
Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products. In this website I have tried to make custom 3d shirt designing website

In this website, the stack which is used are:-
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

There also features like:-
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Add custom color and file support.
- Download the resulting t-shirt model image
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance
